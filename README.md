# RandomPrograms
2012-2013 - A number of different programs that ended up in the default project folder.

Notable Project:

RubicsCube - Program able to solve a rubics cube. Used later for robot to make a robot solve a rubics cube

towers - AKA ShapeWar. Attempt at an RTS where players cover territory to get resources and create buildings to spawn units to destory enemy base. Multiplayer was never implemented however because this was one of my first major projects and the code is super spaghetti.
